the	0

to	0

than	0
photogrammetry,	0
MFPI	0
0	0
reveals	0
the	0
full-field	0
object	0
shape	0
and	0

The	0
main	0
0	0
drawback	0
of	0
MFPI	0
is	0
that	0
despite	0
the	0
ability	0
to	0
measure	0
the	0
0	0

encounters	0

0	0
huge	0

when	0
tracking	0
the	0
in-plane	0
motion.	0
9	0
The	0
third	0
0	0
method	0
is	0
image	0
correlation.	0
The	0
underlying	0
principle	0
is	0
to	0
0	0
track	0
the	0
motion	0
of	0

The	0

can	0
be	0
found	0
by	0

Image	0

has	0
only	0
recently	0

0	0
popular.	0
11	0
It	0
has	0
been	0

to	0

In	0
0	0
spite	0
of	0
all	0
this,	0
image	0
correlation	0
has	0
drawbacks.	0
The	0
main	0
0	0
one	0
is	0
that	0
the	0
spatial	0
resolution	0
is	0
confined	0
by	0
the	0
interroga-	0
0	0

The	0
task	0
of	0
this	0
paper	0
is	0
to	0
explore	0
a	0
power-	0
0	0
ful	0
method	0
that	0
possesses	0
higher	0
spatial	0
resolution	0
than	0
image	0
0	0
correlation	0
while	0
preserving	0
the	0
high	0
accuracy.	0
Optical	0
flow	0
is	0
0	0
very	0
likely	0
to	0
challenge	0
image	0
correlation	0
in	0
this	0
case.	0
Optical	0
0	0
flow	0
calculates	0
the	0
velocity	0
field	0
of	0
pattern	0
motions	0
in	0
2-D	0
0	0
images.	0
It	0
is	0
an	0
effective	0
technique	0
to	0
track	0
the	0
motion	0
of	0
an	0
0	0
object.	0
For	0
example,	0
optical	0
flow	0
has	0
been	0
used	0
to	0
detect	0
0	0
human	0
movements,	0
navigate	0
vehicles,	0
and	0
measure	0
surface	0
0	0
strain,	0
plant	0
growth,	0
and	0
flow	0
motion.	0
Nevertheless,	0
optical	0
0	0
flow	0
has	0
rarely	0
been	0
applied	0
to	0
measuring	0
the	0
deformation	0
of	0
0	0
aircraft	0
or	0
wings	0
in	0
wind	0
tunnels.	0
The	0
main	0
reason	0
lies	0
in	0
the	0
0	0
fact	0
that	0
those	0
mentioned	0
techniques	0
are	0
well	0
developed	0
and	0
0	0
perform	0
well.	0
0	0
Actually,	0
there	0
is	0
a	0
close	0
relationship	0
between	0
optical	0

0	0
and	0
image	0
correlation.	0

that	0

Optical	0

is	0
usually	0
classified	0
into	0
two	0
categories:	0
glo-	0
0	0

methods	0

17	0
and	0
local	0

0	0
based	0
on	0
the	0
LucasKanade	0
(LK)	0
scheme.	0
18	0
Both	0
methods	0
0	0
are	0
based	0
on	0
the	0
same	0
assumption	0
that	0
the	0
pixel	0

of	0

does	0
not	0

This	0
is	0
known	0
as	0
the	0

To	0
calculate	0
the	0

0	0

apart	0
from	0
this	0
assumption,	0
more	0

are	0
0	0
required.	0
HS	0
scheme	0
assumes	0
that	0
the	0
velocity	0

varies	0
0	0
globally	0
smoothly	0
and	0
neighboring	0
pixels	0
have	0
almost	0
the	0
0	0
same	0
velocity,	0
while	0
LK	0
scheme	0
assumes	0
that	0
the	0
velocity	0
field	0
0	0
keeps	0
locally	0
constant	0
and	0
neighboring	0
pixels	0
in	0
one	0
interroga-	0

share	0
the	0

As	0
a	0

HS	0
generates	0
0	0
a	0
dense	0
velocity	0
field	0
and	0
it	0
is	0
sensitive	0
to	0
outliers	0
and	0

0	0
while	0
LK	0
generates	0
a	0

it	0
0	0
offers	0
